# Verification

## Phase 1A

Date: 2026-05-31

### Commands run

```bash
pytest -q test/test_layout_analyzer.py
```

Result: not run in this local shell because `pytest` is not installed.

```bash
python3 -m pytest -q test/test_layout_analyzer.py
```

Result: not run in this local Python environment because the `pytest` module is not installed.

```bash
python3 -m py_compile pdf2docx/page/LayoutAnalyzer.py test/test_layout_analyzer.py
```

Result: passed.

```bash
python3 -m unittest discover -s test -p 'test_layout_analyzer.py'
```

Result: passed. 8 tests ran successfully.

### Notes

- Phase 1A tests use synthetic dictionaries and do not require real PDF rendering.
- The new internal utility is not imported by `Converter`, `Pages`, public package exports, or the CLI.
- Existing PDF-to-DOCX conversion output should be unchanged because no conversion pipeline code was modified.
- Full existing conversion tests were not run in this local environment because project test dependencies such as `pytest` and `PyMuPDF` are not installed here.

## Phase 1B

Date: 2026-05-31

### Commands run

```bash
python3 -m py_compile pdf2docx/page/LayoutAnalyzer.py pdf2docx/page/Pages.py pdf2docx/converter.py test/test_layout_analyzer.py
```

Result: passed.

```bash
python3 -m unittest discover -s test -p 'test_layout_analyzer.py'
```

Result: passed. 9 tests ran successfully.

```bash
python3 -m pytest -q test/test_layout_analyzer.py
```

Result: not run in this local Python environment because the `pytest` module is not installed.

```bash
git diff --check
```

Result: passed.

### Notes

- Phase 1B adds an opt-in `layout_analysis=True` report path during document parsing.
- Normal conversion output should remain unchanged because the report is only built on explicit opt-in and no body/table/image/shape structures are mutated.
- `Converter.store()` includes `layout_analysis` only when a report exists, so the default serialize/debug payload remains unchanged.
- No deviations from the Phase 1 plan were needed.
- Full existing conversion tests were not run in this local environment because project test dependencies such as `pytest` and `PyMuPDF` are not installed here.

## Phase 1C

Date: 2026-05-31

### Commands run

```bash
python3 -m py_compile pdf2docx/page/LayoutAnalyzer.py test/test_layout_analyzer.py
```

Result: passed.

```bash
python3 -m unittest discover -s test -p 'test_layout_analyzer.py'
```

Result: passed. 14 tests ran successfully.

```bash
python3 -m pytest -q test/test_layout_analyzer.py
```

Result: not run in this local Python environment because the `pytest` module is not installed.

```bash
git diff --check
```

Result: passed.

### Notes

- Phase 1C adds paragraph continuation candidate scoring to the existing opt-in `layout_analysis` report only.
- The report now includes `paragraph_continuation_candidates` with previews, score, label, positive/negative signals, and a reason summary.
- No DOCX generation path, body/header/footer filtering, table/image/shape behavior, public CLI, or paragraph mutation code was modified.
- Normal conversion output should remain unchanged by design because the new logic only runs while building the explicit opt-in analysis report.
- Full existing conversion tests were not run in this local environment because project test dependencies such as `pytest` and `PyMuPDF` are not installed here.

## Test Environment Verification and Phase 1D

Date: 2026-05-31

### Repository test configuration

- Inspected `requirements.txt`, `setup.py`, `.github/workflows/test.yml`, and `.github/workflows/publish.yml`.
- `pyproject.toml`, `tox.ini`, `pytest.ini`, and `setup.cfg` were not present.
- The CI workflow installs project requirements, installs `pytest`, runs `python setup.py develop`, and then runs `pytest -v ./test/test.py::TestConversion`.
- Phase 1D used the narrower layout-analysis commands requested for this local validation task.

### Environment and dependency status

```bash
python3 --version
```

Result: Python 3.10.12.

```bash
python3 -m pip --version
```

Result: system pip 22.0.2.

```bash
python3 -m pip show pytest
python3 -m pip show PyMuPDF
python3 -c "import fitz; print(fitz.__doc__[:120])"
```

Result: `pytest` and `PyMuPDF` were not installed in the system Python environment, and `fitz` import failed.

```bash
python3 -m venv .venv
```

Result: failed because this system Python does not have `ensurepip` / `python3.10-venv` available.

```bash
python3 -m pip install --target /tmp/pdf2docx-venv-bootstrap virtualenv
PYTHONPATH=/tmp/pdf2docx-venv-bootstrap python3 -m virtualenv --clear .venv
.venv/bin/python -m pip install -e . pytest
.venv/bin/python -m pip install 'pytest<9'
```

Result: created a local `.venv` and installed project dependencies locally. No project dependency files were changed.

- Local `pytest`: 8.4.2.
- Local `PyMuPDF`: 1.27.2.3.
- Local `fitz` import: available.

### Commands run

```bash
.venv/bin/python -m pytest -q test/test_layout_analyzer.py
```

Result: failed when `TMP` / `TEMP` pointed to the Windows temp directory under `/mnt/c/.../Temp`; pytest capture hit `FileNotFoundError` while truncating a temporary file. This is an environment temp-file issue, not a layout analyzer assertion failure.

```bash
TMPDIR=/tmp TEMP=/tmp TMP=/tmp .venv/bin/python -m pytest -q test/test_layout_analyzer.py
```

Result: passed. 14 tests ran successfully.

```bash
TMPDIR=/tmp TEMP=/tmp TMP=/tmp .venv/bin/python -m py_compile pdf2docx/page/LayoutAnalyzer.py pdf2docx/page/Pages.py pdf2docx/converter.py test/test_layout_analyzer.py
```

Result: passed.

```bash
TMPDIR=/tmp TEMP=/tmp TMP=/tmp .venv/bin/python -m unittest discover -s test -p 'test_layout_analyzer.py'
```

Result: passed. 14 tests ran successfully.

```bash
git diff --check
```

Result: passed.

### Local sample handling

- Copied the provided PDF to `local_samples/input.pdf`.
- Generated the opt-in report at `local_reports/input-layout-analysis-report.json`.
- Added `.venv/`, `local_samples/`, and `local_reports/` to `.gitignore`.
- Confirmed `local_samples/input.pdf` and the generated JSON report are ignored and not tracked by Git.
- No DOCX was generated for this validation.

### Phase 1D sample report summary

The report was generated with `layout_analysis=True` through `Converter.parse()` only. No normal DOCX conversion path was invoked or changed.

- Pages analyzed: 12.
- Text blocks / placeholders summarized: 790.
- Region totals: 164 top, 520 body, 106 bottom.
- Repeated text candidate clusters: 9 total.
- Repeated candidate regions: 4 top-region clusters and 5 bottom-region clusters.
- Repeated candidate support counts: four clusters appeared on all 12 pages; one appeared on 10 pages; one appeared on 8 pages; three appeared on 2 adjacent pages.
- Paragraph continuation entries: 11 page-pair entries.
- Continuation labels: 9 `unlikely`, 2 `weak`, 0 `candidate`.
- Continuation score range: 0.0 to 0.45.

Header/footer observations without extracted text:

- The analyzer found a strong all-page top-region candidate that looks like a document title/header.
- The analyzer found strong all-page bottom-region candidates including a normalized page-number placeholder and footer-like repeated text.
- Repeated image placeholders were also clustered in top/bottom regions. These are useful as layout signals, but they need image identity and position metadata before being treated as true semantic headers or footers.
- Low-support two-page top/bottom repeated clusters appear likely to be false positives from body content near page boundaries rather than real headers or footers.

Paragraph continuation observations:

- No page pair crossed the current `candidate` threshold.
- The two `weak` entries look risky rather than clearly correct because they involve very short text or placeholder-like next/previous blocks.
- Several `unlikely` entries were correctly suppressed by sentence-ending punctuation, heading-like next blocks, style mismatch, or boundary mismatch signals.

### Remaining risks and next recommendation

- The analyzer is still text-block centric; it needs better handling for image placeholders, list markers, and very short blocks before any body mutation is safe.
- Repeated body text near page boundaries can still look like a header/footer candidate when it appears on adjacent pages.
- Section-specific headers and first-page exceptions need explicit modeling before Phase 2 header/footer removal.
- Next phase should remain report-only or introduce more debug-only scoring signals first: minimum text length filters, placeholder-specific handling, list/number-only suppression, repeated-cluster exclusion during continuation scoring, and richer body-region margin inference.
